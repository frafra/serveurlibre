Simple POS based on Django which supports a couple of Meteor printers

This is a **personal project**, nothing professional, developed in 2012/2013, initially based on Django 1.4, then ported to Django 1.8.
I choose to publish the code on GitHub under a free software license because it makes no sense to me to keep it on my computer; maybe it could be useful for somebody else.

It contains some comments in Italian (sorry about that), it uses jQuery without any fancy Bootstrap-like framework.

Even if the code quality is not very high (there's plenty of room for optimization), but it works just fine: it has been able to manage about 100.000 orders using old computers without a hitch.
